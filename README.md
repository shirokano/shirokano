# Intro

👋 Hello World! I'm Simon, a software engineer and this is my personal portfolio website 🌐. It's a showcase my work experience, achievements, and an all-around summary of my skills. 🚀

Moreover, it also serves as a learning lab 📚 where I continuously explore new technologies and share my insights through blogging. 📝

## CI/CD

I've set up a GitHub workflow to work its magic by running tests and keeping our code "pretty". This dynamic duo not only safeguards against sneaky bugs making their way into production 🐛 ⛔ but also gives our code that stylish, well-groomed look. You can unleash this superpower before you commit or push changes with these simple commands:

- `npm run format` 🎨
- `npm run test` 🧪

## Tech Stack

- `React`
- `Typescript`
- `Bash`
